#X text 16 19 Beware monome device prefixes!;
#X text 16 56 While the [monome] object itself is capable of communicating
with any monome device regardless of prefix \, due to limitations with
puredata’s OSC support \, it’s not practical for the various grid/arc
UI element objects to offer prefix support.;
#X text 16 140 Therefore \, all UI element objects will ONLY work with
monome devices where the prefix is set to /monome! This is the default
\, so if you have no idea what the prefix is: don’t worry about it.

#X text 15 301 To set a device’s prefix back to /monome \, to enable
UI objects \, use the following patch \, again into the [monome] object’s
first inlet:;
#X text 14 211 To check a device’s prefix \, send the following OSC
to its [monome] object (first inlet) and observe the console:;
#X obj 19 390 oscformat sys prefix;
#X msg 19 366 list /monome;
#X connect 7 0 6 0;
