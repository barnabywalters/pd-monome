# pd-monome

A collection of pure data objects designed for connecting to and communicating with monome devices.

[Download the repository](https://github.com/barnabywalters/pd-monome/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and move the  `monome` folder to somewhere in your puredata path.

Use the `[monome]` object to connect to grids and arcs.

Use the various `[monome/grid/*]` objects to quickly create grid applications.

Take a look at the `examples` and the built-in help patches to see how.

More grid UI elements, utils and arc objects coming soon!

Having problems? Got ideas? File a new issue. Please include as much relevant information as possible, e.g. operating system, pd version, grid hardware, output from `/sys/info`, etc.
