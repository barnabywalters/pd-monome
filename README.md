# pd-monome

A collection of pure data objects designed for connecting to and communicating with monome devices.

Download and add the top level `/monome` folder to somewhere in your puredata path.

Use the `[monome]` object to connect to grids and arcs.

Use the various `monome/grid` objects to quickly create grid applications.

Take a look at the `examples` and the built-in help patches to see how.

More grid UI elements, utils and arc objects coming soon!
